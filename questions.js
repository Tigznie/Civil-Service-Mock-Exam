Zuckerberg said, -The Internet works because most people and companies do the same. We work together to create this secure environment and make our shared space even better for the world. This is why I've been so confused and frustrated by the repeated reports of the behavior of the U.S. government. When engineers work tirelessly to improve security, we imagine we're protecting you against criminals, not our own government. The U.S. government should be the champion for the Internet, not a threat. It needs to be much more transparent about what it's doing, or people will believe the worst. I've called President Obama to express my frustration over the damage the government is creating for all of our future. Unfortunately, it seems like it will take a very long time for true full reform. So it's up to us all of us – to build the Internet we want. Together, we can build a space that is greater and a more important part of the world than anything we have today, but is also safe and secure. I'm committed to seeing this happen, and you can count on Facebook to do our part."

The weather was fine when the aircraft was flying so it adds more theories about other possible reasons of the aircraft's fate. The oil slick spotted off Vietnam's coast turned out to be fuel oil used in cargo ships so it has nothing to do with the aircraft. Interpol also says the disappearance of the jet plane has nothing to do with terrorist attack. More questions are adding to this quest and no specific answer is given and proven yet."

It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my my dad, foot down; these past three summers, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead.
